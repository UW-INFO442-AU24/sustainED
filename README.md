### Mission
SustainED is a website aimed at helping teachers in the Seattle Public School district to provide activities, events, lessons and resources aimed at improving their skills and abilities realted to Sustainability. By providing these resources, we hope to make teachers feel more confident and therefore increase the presence of sustainability lessons in the K-12 curriculum in the area.

### Problem Statement:
#### According to the United Nations’ Department of Economic and Social Affairs and their Statistical Division, 69% of ninth-grade science and social science curricula do not mention climate change, and 66% omit sustainability. Not only this but 50% of teachers admitted to not teaching these subjects due to a lack the confidence or willingness to teach them (United Nations Statistics Division, n.d.). With climate change becoming the biggest threat facing humanity, and counting human activities as its main driver (United Nations, n.d.), it is imperative that this problem in education is addressed as soon as possible.

#### Teachers find it difficult to fit these topics into their curriculum due to a lack of expertise, materials, and time (Will, 2023). Continuous focus on traditional topics makes it difficult for teachers to change the curriculum enough to reflect real understanding for students regarding sustainability. Likewise, new challenges occur to deteriorate the quality of education across all countries. The massive COVID-19 pandemic has caused a massive halt in the learning efforts of young students, causing “learning loss in four out of 5 of the 104 countries” that the UN studied. Various experimental education methods have been used to compensate for the circumstances of the pandemic, but require improvements for their effectiveness. 

#### The Seattle Public Schools’ Sustainable Vision, Goals, and Strategy report details a commitment to integrate sustainability into the required curriculum and allow teachers more flexibility to develop applied learning opportunities (Seattle Public Schools, 2021). Through focusing on goal 4 of the UN’s SDG, Quality Education with a specific emphasis on Target 4.7, we hope to contribute to the development of knowledge and skills necessary to promote sustainable development by 2030 in the Seattle area. Additionally, we will align our project with SDG Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production by educating students on sustainable practices related to resource management, waste reduction, and mindful consumption habits. 


### HMW statement: 
#### How might we provide high school students in the Seattle area with the knowledge to improve their skills related to maintaining an environmentally sustainable lifestyle so that they can be better prepared to face climate change and reduce its effects and advancement?

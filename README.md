### Mission
SustainED is a website aimed at helping teachers in the Seattle Public School district to provide activities, events, lessons and resources aimed at improving their skills and abilities realted to Sustainability. By providing these resources, we hope to make teachers feel more confident and therefore increase the presence of sustainability lessons in the K-12 curriculum in the area.

### Problem Statement:
#### According to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs and their Statistical Division, 69% of ninth-grade science and social science curricula do not mention climate change, and 66% omit sustainability. Not only this but 50% of teachers admitted to not teaching these subjects due to a lack the confidence or willingness to teach them (United Nations Statistics Division, n.d.). With climate change becoming the biggest threat facing humanity, and counting human activities as its main driver (United Nations, n.d.), it is imperative that this problem in education is addressed as soon as possible.

#### Teachers find it difficult to fit these topics into their curriculum due to a lack of expertise, materials, and time (Will, 2023). Continuous focus on traditional topics makes it difficult for teachers to change the curriculum enough to reflect real understanding for students regarding sustainability. Likewise, new challenges occur to deteriorate the quality of education across all countries. The massive COVID-19 pandemic has caused a massive halt in the learning efforts of young students, causing “learning loss in four out of 5 of the 104 countries” that the UN studied. Various experimental education methods have been used to compensate for the circumstances of the pandemic, but require improvements for their effectiveness. 

#### The Seattle Public Schools’ Sustainable Vision, Goals, and Strategy report details a commitment to integrate sustainability into the required curriculum and allow teachers more flexibility to develop applied learning opportunities (Seattle Public Schools, 2021). Through focusing on goal 4 of the UN’s SDG, Quality Education with a specific emphasis on Target 4.7, we hope to contribute to the development of knowledge and skills necessary to promote sustainable development by 2030 in the Seattle area. Additionally, we will align our project with SDG Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production by educating students on sustainable practices related to resource management, waste reduction, and mindful consumption habits. 


### HMW statement: 
How might we support Seattle high school educators in teaching students the necessary skills for sustainable living to combat climate change?

### Bugs
We are aware that not every combination of quiz options will yield three recommended resources. This is due to time constraints that prevented us from finding a matching set of resources for every possible combination of options. Our temporary workaround is to select the following options: 
- Any grade level
- Media type: PDFs or Podcasts
- Subject area: Science, English or Math
- Time range: 15-30 minutes or Less than 15 minutes (only if the podcast option was chosen earlier)
- Area: Impacts of Climate Change
